\begin{resume}

{\sc Research Interests} Cardiovascular modelling, biological flows, cerebral fluid dynamics, nutrient dynamics, research software development\\

My research focusses on developing coupled and multi-scale analytical and numerical models of intramural periarterial drainage of waste products from the brain. My major contributions to the field are disproving the often cited hypothesis that periarterial drainage through the cerebrovascular basement membrane is driven by arterial pulsations and providing the first evidence for a new hypothesis, which links waste clearance to functional hyperaemia. This new hypothesis lines up with recommendations on the reduction of one's individual risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. I am passionate about sustainable research software development and have thus published software and data from my research projects on Github, as well as in research software journals.\\
